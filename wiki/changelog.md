# Changelog

All notable changes to DBackup are documented here.

## v1.0.1 - Hotfix Release
*Release: In Progress*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Database Picker — Mouse Wheel Scrolling** — The database selection dropdown (and all other `CommandList`-based dropdowns) did not respond to mouse wheel scrolling. Radix `ScrollArea` sets `overflow-y: hidden` on the viewport via inline style by default, blocking native wheel events. Fixed by adding an `onWheel` handler to `CommandList` that forwards wheel delta directly to the `ScrollArea` viewport's `scrollTop`, bypassing the inline style restriction entirely
- **MSSQL Backup — Silent Failure with Missing Error Details** — When a MSSQL `BACKUP DATABASE` command failed in production, the execution log only showed the generic `"BACKUP DATABASE is terminating abnormally"` error without revealing the actual cause (e.g., permission denied, disk full, path not found). SQL Server sends the real error details as informational messages *before* the final error, but the `executeQuery` function did not capture these messages. Added `executeQueryWithMessages()` in `connection.ts` that listens to the `mssql` request's `info` event to collect all SQL Server messages during execution. On success, progress messages (e.g., "10 percent processed") are logged to the execution output. On failure, detail messages are appended to the error (e.g., `"BACKUP DATABASE is terminating abnormally — Details: Cannot open backup device '...'. Operating system error 5(Access is denied.)"`). Both `dump.ts` and `restore.ts` now use this enhanced function for BACKUP/RESTORE operations

### 📝 Documentation

- **README & Wiki updated** — Feature list revised to be more accurate and less marketing-heavy. Added Multi-Destination Jobs, Storage Monitoring & Alerts, and Storage Explorer as explicit feature entries. Notification count updated to `9+`. Community & Support section added with Discord, GitLab Issues, support email (`support@dbackup.app`), and security disclosure address (`security@dbackup.app`)
- **User Guide rework** — The Getting Started guide has been rewritten and expanded into a multi-page User Guide section:
  - **Getting Started** — Overview of features, prerequisites, installation options, and next steps
  - **First Steps** — Detailed walkthrough of creating your first backup job, running it, and setting up notifications
  - **First Backup** — (moved to First Steps) Step-by-step instructions for configuring a backup job with screenshots

## v1.0.0 - First Stable Release
*Released: March 10, 2026*

🎉 **DBackup 1.0.0 — the first stable release.** This version stabilizes the platform after the extensive beta phase, ships quality-of-life fixes for the API trigger workflow, hardens job status tracking with stale execution recovery, adds update notifications with configurable reminder intervals, and polishes the dashboard UI.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Database Reset Required** — All Prisma migrations have been squashed into a single `0_init` migration for the v1.0.0 release. Existing databases from beta versions are **not compatible** and must be recreated. **Before upgrading**, export your configuration via Settings → Config Backup. After upgrading, run `npx prisma migrate deploy` (or let Docker handle it automatically) and re-import your configuration

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔄 Session Management
- **Admin Session Duration** — Administrators can now configure the session lifetime in Settings → Authentication & Security. Options range from 1 hour to 90 days (default: 7 days). The setting takes effect for all new logins immediately — existing sessions retain their original expiration
- **Sessions Tab in Profile** — Users can view all their active sessions under Profile → Sessions. Each session shows the browser (with brand icon), operating system (with OS icon), IP address, creation time, and "last seen" timestamp
- **Browser-Specific Icons** — Sessions display Iconify brand icons for Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Arc, and Tor Browser. Unknown browsers fall back to device-type icons (desktop/mobile/tablet)
- **OS Icons** — Operating system icons are shown inline next to the OS name (Apple, Windows, Linux, Android)
- **Revoke Individual Sessions** — Each session (except the current one) has a delete button to revoke it immediately, forcing a re-login on that device
- **Revoke All Other Sessions** — A "Revoke All Others" button signs out all devices except the current one, with a confirmation dialog

#### 🔄 Stale Execution Recovery on Startup
- **Crash Recovery** — When the application is hard-killed (SIGKILL, power loss, OOM) while a backup or restore is running, the affected executions remain stuck in `Running` or `Pending` state indefinitely
- **Automatic Detection** — On every application startup, DBackup now scans for executions in `Running` or `Pending` state and marks them as `Failed`
- **Audit Log Entry** — A log entry is appended to each recovered execution explaining the cause:
  - Running → *"Execution was interrupted by an unexpected application shutdown"*
  - Pending → *"Execution was cancelled because the application shut down before it could start"*
- **Queue Safety** — Recovery runs before the scheduler initializes, ensuring the queue starts clean without stale `Running` entries blocking slot allocation
- **Non-Blocking** — Individual recovery failures are logged and skipped without aborting the startup sequence

#### 🔔 Update Available Notification
- **New Notification Event** — "Update Available" is now a registered system notification event under a new **Updates** category in Settings → Notifications. When enabled, DBackup sends a notification through configured channels (Email, Discord, etc.) whenever a new version is detected
- **Deduplication** — Notifications are deduplicated: a notification is sent immediately when a new version is first detected, and re-sent only after the configured reminder interval (default: 7 days). When the app is updated to the latest version, the state resets automatically for future update cycles
- **Test Notification** — A "Test" button is available in notification settings to preview the update notification on all configured channels

#### ⏰ Configurable Reminder Intervals
- **Per-Event Reminder Settings** — Notification events that support reminders (storage alerts, update available) now show a "Repeat reminder" dropdown in Settings → Notifications, allowing users to choose how often a persistent condition triggers re-notifications
- **Interval Options** — Disabled, Every 6h, Every 12h, Every 24h (default), Every 2 days, Every 7 days, Every 14 days
- **Disable Reminders** — Selecting "Disabled" sends only the initial notification when a condition first becomes active — no repeated reminders while the condition persists
- **Applies to Storage Alerts** — Storage Usage Spike, Storage Limit Warning, and Missing Backup alerts now respect the configured reminder interval instead of the previous hardcoded 24-hour cooldown

#### 🔀 Multi-Destination Fan-Out (3-2-1 Backup Rule)
- **Multiple Destinations per Job** — A single backup job can now upload to an unlimited number of storage destinations (e.g., local + S3 + Dropbox). All destinations are equal — no primary/secondary distinction
- **Per-Destination Retention** — Each destination has its own independent retention policy (None, Simple, or Smart/GFS). Configure different retention strategies per destination — for example, keep 30 daily backups locally but only 12 monthly backups in cloud storage
- **Sequential Upload** — Backups are uploaded to each destination sequentially in priority order. The dump and compression/encryption pipeline runs only once — the resulting file is uploaded to each destination in turn
- **Partial Success Status** — New `Partial` execution status for mixed results: if some destinations succeed and others fail, the execution is marked as "Partial" instead of flat "Failed". Partial triggers notifications on both ALWAYS and FAILURE_ONLY events
- **Per-Destination Results** — Execution metadata now includes a `destinationResults` array showing the individual success/failure status for each destination, visible in the execution detail view
- **Inline Retention Config** — The job form now embeds retention settings directly inside each destination row via a collapsible panel, replacing the previous standalone Retention tab. Each destination can be expanded to configure its own retention strategy
- **Duplicate Prevention** — The destination selector prevents selecting the same storage destination twice within a single job
- **Adapter Icons in Job Table** — The Jobs list now shows adapter brand icons (Dropbox, S3, Local, etc.) alongside destination and source names for quick visual identification

#### 🗄️ Database Selection in Job Configuration
- **Moved to Job** — Database selection has been moved from the Source (adapter) configuration to the Job form. Sources now define only *how to connect* (host, port, credentials), while the Job controls *what to back up* (which databases, schedule, destinations). This provides a clean separation: one Source can be reused by multiple Jobs with different database selections
- **DatabasePicker in Job Form** — The General tab of the job form now includes a multi-select `DatabasePicker` below the Source selector. Click "Load Databases" to fetch the list from the server, then select specific databases to back up
- **Empty = All** — When no databases are selected, the backup includes all databases — matching the previous default behavior. Existing jobs with databases configured in their Source continue to work unchanged
- **SQLite & Redis Excluded** — The picker is hidden for SQLite (single file, no database selection) and Redis (database index is a connection parameter, not a backup selection)
- **New API Endpoint** — `GET /api/adapters/{id}/databases` fetches the available database list for any saved Source configuration, used by the DatabasePicker in the job form

#### 🔄 Config Backup & Restore — Enhanced Import Pipeline
- **Statistics & History Export/Import** — Config Backup now includes an "Include Statistics" toggle that exports Audit Logs and Execution History. On import, a corresponding checkbox lets users choose whether to restore statistics data alongside the configuration
- **Smart Recovery** — When restoring a config backup through the dedicated Restore page, the system detects encryption and compression from the `.meta.json` sidecar file and automatically applies the correct decryption/decompression pipeline before parsing the JSON payload
- **Full FK Remapping System** — Config Restore now builds four ID mapping tables (`adapterIdMap`, `profileIdMap`, `groupIdMap`, `userIdMap`) during import. When an entity with the same name already exists locally, the backup's ID is mapped to the existing local ID. All foreign key references throughout the import — JobDestinations, Job notifications, User group assignments, Account user links, API Key ownership, AuditLog authors, and Execution job references — are remapped through these maps, preventing FK constraint violations
- **Name-Based Deduplication** — Instead of upserting by ID (which created duplicates when backup IDs didn't match local IDs), the restore pipeline now checks by name (and type for adapters) before deciding to create or update. This prevents duplicate Sources, Destinations, Encryption Profiles, Jobs, Groups, Users, and SSO Providers after repeated config restores
- **SSO Client-Secret Encryption on Import** — When restoring SSO provider configurations, `clientId` and `clientSecret` are re-encrypted with the current instance's `ENCRYPTION_KEY` before storage, ensuring imported SSO credentials work correctly on the target instance

#### 🔒 Unique Name Enforcement
- **Server-Side Uniqueness Checks** — All entity creation and update endpoints now enforce unique names at the application level: Sources/Destinations (name + type), Jobs (name), Encryption Profiles (name), and Groups (name). Duplicate names return HTTP 409 Conflict with a descriptive error message
- **UI Conflict Feedback** — When a name conflict is detected during Source/Destination, Job, or Profile creation, the error message from the server is displayed in a toast notification instead of a generic "Operation failed" message

### 🔒 Security

- **Auth Rate-Limiting Middleware** — Fixed the Next.js middleware matcher to correctly apply rate limiting to authentication endpoints. The previous matcher pattern silently excluded auth routes, leaving login/register endpoints unprotected against brute-force attacks
- **Command Injection Prevention** — All database adapter configurations now validate host, username, and path fields through strict Zod schemas that reject shell metacharacters (`; | & $ \` \\`). This hardens the system against command injection via adapter config fields that are interpolated into CLI commands
- **SQL Injection Prevention (MSSQL)** — MSSQL adapter queries that interpolate database names now properly escape identifiers using bracket notation, preventing SQL injection through crafted database names
- **SSO Client-Secret Encryption** — SSO provider `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields are now encrypted at rest using the system `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256-GCM), consistent with how database adapter passwords are stored

### 🎨 UI Improvements

- **Update Indicator Redesign** — Replaced the orange pulsing update indicator in the sidebar with a muted, non-animated design: subtle `ArrowUpCircle` icon in the version footer, small blue dot on the avatar badge, and blue-tinted "Update available" entry in the user dropdown — consistent with the overall dark/minimal design language
- **Job Form — Dual-Mode Schedule Picker** — Replaced the plain cron text input with a new `SchedulePicker` component that offers two modes, toggled via a compact pill switch in the header:
  - **Simple Mode** — Frequency selector (Hourly / Daily / Weekly / Monthly) as pill buttons, with contextual dropdowns for day-of-week, day-of-month, hour, and minute. A human-readable description in the header summarizes the selection (e.g., "Runs every Monday at 14:30")
  - **Cron Mode** — Raw cron expression input with monospace font for power users, identical to the previous behavior
  - **Auto-Detection** — Existing cron values are automatically parsed into Simple Mode when they match a supported pattern; complex expressions default to Cron Mode
  - **User Time Format** — The schedule description respects the user's configured time format (12h/24h) and timezone from their profile settings, using the same `formatInTimeZone` logic as `DateDisplay`
- **Job Form — General Tab Layout** — Reorganized the General tab: Source and Active Status are now side by side in the top row, with the Schedule Picker spanning full width below — giving the schedule controls more room and reducing vertical stacking
- **Job Form — 4-Tab Layout** — Restructured the job form into four tabs: General (source, status, schedule), Destinations (multi-destination list with per-destination retention), Security (encryption, compression), and Notify (notification channels and event filter)
- **Job Form — Destination ScrollArea** — Added a scrollable container for the destinations list with a 400px max height, preventing the form from growing excessively when many destinations are configured
- **Job Form — Database Selection** — New `DatabasePicker` section in the General tab between Source/Active Status and Schedule. Shows only when a non-SQLite/Redis source is selected. Includes "Load Databases" button that fetches available databases from the server via the new API endpoint
- **Source Form — Database Field Removed** — The `database` text field has been removed from the Configuration tab of database source forms (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSSQL). Database selection is now exclusively done in the Job form. Redis retains its 0–15 connection database dropdown
- **Restore Page — Statistics Checkbox** — The Config Restore page now shows an "Include Statistics" checkbox when the backup contains statistics data, allowing users to choose whether to restore Audit Logs and Execution History
- **Name Conflict Error Messages** — When creating or editing a Source, Destination, Job, Encryption Profile, or Group with a name that already exists, the server's descriptive error message (e.g., "A source with the name 'Production MySQL' already exists") is now displayed in a toast notification instead of a generic "Operation failed"

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Redis Database Selector** — The Redis adapter configuration incorrectly showed a multi-select `DatabasePicker` (designed for MySQL/PostgreSQL "select which databases to back up"). Redis backups always dump all 16 databases via `redis-cli --rdb`, so the selector has been replaced with a 0–15 dropdown for selecting the connection default database (`SELECT` command). Database 0 is labeled "Default (0)"
- **Pending Icon Color** — Database icon in the "Latest Jobs" dashboard widget was incorrectly shown in red for `Pending` executions. Pending jobs now display a yellow icon, consistent with the yellow `Pending` status badge
- **API Trigger — Bash Script Error Handling** — The generated Bash script now checks whether the API returned `success: true` before attempting to parse `.data.status`. Previously, a missing `history:read` permission on the API key caused a silent `null` status, leading to "Unknown status: null" and immediate exit
- **API Trigger — Missing Permission Documentation** — The API Trigger dialog stated only `jobs:execute` was required to use the polling workflow. The status polling endpoint (`GET /api/executions/{id}`) also requires `history:read` — both permissions are now clearly listed in the dialog description, Overview tab, and generated scripts
- **API Trigger — cURL Placeholder Clarity** — The "Poll Execution Status" and "Poll with Logs" cURL examples used a bare `EXECUTION_ID` placeholder without explanation. The placeholder is now formatted as `{EXECUTION_ID}` and each example includes an explicit hint: *"Replace `{EXECUTION_ID}` with the `executionId` from the trigger response"*
- **Edge Runtime — Rate Limit Module** — Importing `node:crypto` in the rate-limit module caused a build error because Next.js middleware runs in the Edge Runtime (which lacks Node.js built-ins). Split `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` into an Edge-safe middleware module and a server-only module that uses `node:crypto` for HMAC operations
- **Config Restore — Include Statistics Toggle** — The "Include Statistics" checkbox on the restore page was not persisted because the field was missing from the Zod validation schema. Added `includeStatistics` to the restore options schema
- **Config Restore — Download Crash** — Downloading a config backup from remote storage for restore failed with "adapter not found" because `registerAdapters()` was not called before resolving the storage adapter. Added the missing registration call
- **Config Restore — Smart Recovery Meta Format** — Smart Recovery failed to detect encryption/compression because it expected a flat `.meta.json` structure, but config backups use a nested format with metadata under a `metadata` key. Updated the parser to handle both flat and nested meta formats
- **Config Restore — Stream Pipeline Failure** — Smart Recovery's decrypt → decompress → parse pipeline silently failed due to a race condition between stream completion and JSON parsing, compounded by error events not propagating across piped streams. Rewrote `runRestorePipeline()` with explicit `pipeline()` chaining, proper error propagation, and eliminated double-decryption that occurred when both the pipeline and caller applied decryption
- **Config Restore — Group Unique Constraint** — Restoring a config backup with Groups failed with a unique constraint violation on `Group.name` when a group with the same name but different ID already existed locally. The restore now checks by name first and updates the existing group instead of attempting to create a duplicate
- **Config Restore — User FK to Group** — Restoring Users failed with a foreign key constraint violation because the User's `groupId` pointed to the backup's Group ID, which didn't exist locally when Groups were merged by name. Added `groupIdMap` to remap group references from backup IDs to actual local IDs
- **Config Restore — Account FK to User** — Restoring Accounts failed with a foreign key constraint violation because the Account's `userId` pointed to the backup's User ID. Added `userIdMap` to remap user references throughout the import (Accounts, API Keys)
- **Config Restore — AuditLog FK to User** — Restoring Statistics failed with a foreign key constraint violation on `AuditLog.userId`. The `userIdMap` was scoped inside the Users import block and inaccessible to the Statistics section. Moved the map declaration to the outer scope and added null fallbacks for AuditLog `userId` and Execution `jobId` when the referenced entity doesn't exist locally
- **Config Restore — Duplicate Entries** — Repeated config restores created duplicate Sources, Destinations, Jobs, and Encryption Profiles because the upsert matched on ID (which differs between instances). Replaced ID-based upserts with name-based lookups: adapters match on name+type, profiles on name, jobs on name. All foreign keys are remapped through ID maps to point to the correct local entities

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- **Squashed Migrations** — All 7 beta migrations merged into a single `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql` for a clean v1.0.0 baseline. This creates the complete schema (18 tables) in one step
- Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` — Removed `destinationId` and `retention` from `Job` model; added `JobDestination` model with `id`, `jobId`, `configId`, `priority` (Int, default 0), `retention` (String, default "{}"), timestamps; added `destinations JobDestination[]` on `Job` and `jobDestinations JobDestination[]` on `AdapterConfig`; cascade delete on job
- Updated `src/lib/runner/types.ts` — Added `DestinationContext` interface (configId, configName, adapter, config, retention, priority, uploadResult); updated `RunnerContext` to use `destinations: DestinationContext[]` instead of single `destAdapter`; added `"Partial"` to status union type
- Updated `src/services/job-service.ts` — `CreateJobInput`/`UpdateJobInput` now use `destinations: DestinationInput[]`; `createJob` uses nested Prisma create; `updateJob` uses `$transaction` with `deleteMany` + `createMany`; shared `jobInclude` constant with `destinations: { include: { config: true }, orderBy: { priority: 'asc' } }`
- Updated `src/lib/runner/steps/01-initialize.ts` — Resolves all destination adapters into `ctx.destinations[]` with decrypted configs and retention parsing
- Rewritten `src/lib/runner/steps/03-upload.ts` — Compression/encryption pipeline runs once; sequential upload loop iterates `ctx.destinations` by priority; per-destination progress, logging with `[destName]` prefix, and integrity checks; evaluates mixed results → sets `ctx.status = "Partial"` if some fail
- Rewritten `src/lib/runner/steps/05-retention.ts` — Iterates `ctx.destinations`, skips failed uploads; calls `applyRetentionForDestination()` per destination using its own retention config
- Updated `src/lib/runner/steps/04-completion.ts` — Builds `destinationResults` array in execution metadata; handles "Partial" status in notification logic
- Updated `src/lib/runner.ts` — Added `destinations: []` to context initialization; preserves "Partial" status set by upload step

- New `src/components/dashboard/jobs/schedule-picker.tsx` — Dual-mode schedule configuration component: Simple Mode with frequency pill buttons (Hourly/Daily/Weekly/Monthly) and contextual time/day selects; Cron Mode with raw expression input; card-style layout with header showing human-readable description and compact mode toggle; auto-parses existing cron values into Simple Mode; respects user's time format and timezone via `useSession` + `formatInTimeZone`
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/jobs/jobs-client.tsx` — Destination column shows names with adapter icons from `config` relation instead of IDs; source column enhanced with adapter icon
- Updated `src/components/dashboard/widgets/storage-status.tsx` — Queries via `job.destinations[].configId`; includes "Partial" status executions
- Updated `src/components/dashboard/widgets/recent-activity.tsx` — Include changed to `destinations: { include: { config: true } }`
- Updated `src/services/dashboard-service.ts` — Three queries updated from `{ destinationId: id }` to `{ destinations: { some: { configId: id } } }`
- Updated `src/app/api/adapters/[id]/route.ts` — Deletion check uses `destinations: { some: { configId } }` for job usage detection
- Updated `src/services/integrity-service.ts` — Job lookup uses `destinations: { some: { configId } }` filter
- Updated `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/job-step.tsx` — Payload sends `destinations: [{ configId, priority, retention }]`
- New `src/lib/execution-recovery.ts` — `recoverStaleExecutions()` function; queries executions with `Running` or `Pending` status, updates them to `Failed` with `endedAt` and an explanatory log entry appended to the existing logs JSON
- Updated `src/instrumentation.ts` — Added `recoverStaleExecutions()` as startup step 3 (between rate limit reload and scheduler init)
- Updated `src/components/dashboard/widgets/latest-jobs.tsx` — `SourceIcon` component now receives `isPending` prop; color logic extended to `text-yellow-500` for `Pending` status (previously fell through to `text-red-500`)
- Updated `src/components/dashboard/jobs/api-trigger-dialog.tsx` — Dialog description and Overview tab now list `jobs:execute` + `history:read` as required permissions; cURL poll examples use `{EXECUTION_ID}` placeholder with descriptive hint text; Bash script adds `success` field check before parsing status
- Updated `src/lib/notifications/types.ts` — Added `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` event constant, `UpdateAvailableData` interface, `supportsReminder` flag on `NotificationEventDefinition`, and `reminderIntervalHours` field on per-event notification config
- Updated `src/lib/notifications/events.ts` — Added `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` event definition under new `"updates"` category with `supportsReminder: true`; added `supportsReminder: true` to all three storage alert events

- Updated `src/services/system-task-service.ts` — `runCheckForUpdates()` now dispatches update notifications with deduplication state stored in `SystemSetting` key `update.notification.state`; tracks `lastNotifiedVersion` and `lastNotifiedAt` to prevent duplicate sends; resets state when app is up to date
- Updated `src/services/storage-alert-service.ts` — `shouldNotify()` now accepts optional `cooldownMs` parameter; loads per-event `reminderIntervalHours` from notification config; `cooldownMs === 0` disables reminders (only initial notification fires)
- Updated `src/components/settings/notification-settings.tsx` — Added "Updates" category with `ArrowUpCircle` icon; added "Repeat reminder" `<Select>` dropdown (Disabled / 6h / 12h / 24h / 2d / 7d / 14d) for events with `supportsReminder`
- Updated `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` — Replaced orange animated indicators with muted blue styling: `ArrowUpCircle` icon in footer, 2px blue dot on avatar, blue-tinted dropdown menu item
- Updated `src/app/actions/notification-settings.ts` — Added `update_available` test payload for the test notification button
- Updated `src/components/adapter/form-sections.tsx` — Added `RedisDatabaseSelect` component (0–15 dropdown with `db-` prefixed values to work around Radix UI treating `"0"` as falsy); removed `'database'` key from Configuration tab `FieldList` — database selection moved to Job form; Redis retains its own `RedisDatabaseSelect` dropdown
- New `prisma/migrations/20260310000000_move_database_selection_to_job/migration.sql` — Adds `databases` TEXT column (default `'[]'`) to `Job` table

- Updated `src/services/job-service.ts` — Added `databases?: string[]` to `CreateJobInput`/`UpdateJobInput`; `createJob` serializes with `JSON.stringify(databases || [])`; `updateJob` conditionally includes databases when provided
- New `src/app/api/adapters/[id]/databases/route.ts` — `GET` handler loads `AdapterConfig` by ID, decrypts config, calls `adapter.getDatabases(config)`, returns `{ success, databases }`. Requires `PERMISSIONS.SOURCES.READ`
- Updated `src/app/api/jobs/route.ts` and `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts` — POST/PUT accept `databases` array; passes to job service
- Updated `src/lib/runner/steps/02-dump.ts` — Parses `job.databases` JSON; if non-empty, injects into `sourceConfig.database` before calling `adapter.dump()`. Falls back to source config's own `database` field when job databases is empty (backwards compatible)
- Updated `src/components/dashboard/jobs/job-form.tsx` — Added `databases` to `JobData` interface, form schema (`z.array(z.string()).default([])`), and submit payload; added `DatabasePicker` section in General tab with `fetchDatabases` callback using new API endpoint; source change resets database selection; picker hidden for SQLite/Redis via `adapterId` check

- Updated `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/source-step.tsx` — Removed database-picker related props from `DatabaseFormContent` call
- Updated `src/lib/auth.ts` — Added `getSessionDuration()` function that reads `auth.sessionDuration` from `SystemSetting` table; added `databaseHooks.session.create.before` hook to dynamically set `expiresAt` based on admin-configured session duration; configured `session.expiresIn` default (7 days) and `session.updateAge` (24h)
- Updated `src/app/actions/settings.ts` — Added `sessionDuration` field to settings schema (`z.coerce.number().min(3600).max(7776000).optional()`) and upsert for `auth.sessionDuration` key in `SystemSetting` table
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — Loads `auth.sessionDuration` from database and passes it to `SystemSettingsForm` as `initialSessionDuration`
- Updated `src/components/settings/system-settings-form.tsx` — Added session duration selector (1h–90d) in the "Authentication & Security" card with auto-save
- New `src/components/settings/sessions-form.tsx` — Sessions management component: fetches active sessions via `authClient.listSessions()`, displays browser brand icons (Iconify), OS icons, formatted IP address, creation/last-seen dates; supports revoking individual sessions and all other sessions with confirmation dialog
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` — Added "Sessions" tab (5th tab) to the profile page, rendering `SessionsForm`
- Split `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` into `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` (Edge-safe, no Node.js imports) and `src/lib/rate-limit-server.ts` (server-only, uses `node:crypto` for HMAC); middleware imports only the Edge-safe module
- Updated `src/services/config-service.ts` — Major rewrite of `import()` method: builds four ID mapping tables (`adapterIdMap`, `profileIdMap`, `groupIdMap`, `userIdMap`) during import; all entity sections now check by name before upsert (adapters by name+type, profiles/jobs/groups by name, users by email, SSO providers by providerId); all FK references remapped through maps: `JobDestination.configId` via adapterIdMap, `Job.sourceId` via adapterIdMap, `Job.encryptionProfileId` via profileIdMap, `User.groupId` via groupIdMap, `Account.userId`/`ApiKey.userId` via userIdMap, `AuditLog.userId` via userIdMap with null fallback, `Execution.jobId` verified with null fallback; added `registerAdapters()` call before Smart Recovery pipeline; fixed Smart Recovery meta format detection to handle both flat and nested `.meta.json` structures; rewrote `runRestorePipeline()` with explicit `pipeline()` chaining and proper error propagation
- Updated `src/app/api/adapters/route.ts` — POST handler checks `findFirst({ where: { name, type } })` before create; returns 409 Conflict with descriptive message if duplicate exists
- Updated `src/app/api/adapters/[id]/route.ts` — PUT handler checks `findFirst({ where: { name, type, id: { not: params.id } } })` before update; returns 409 Conflict if another adapter with the same name+type exists
- Updated `src/services/job-service.ts` — `createJob()` checks `findFirst({ where: { name } })` before create; `updateJob()` checks `findFirst({ where: { name, id: { not: id } } })` before update; both throw descriptive Error on conflict
- Updated `src/services/encryption-service.ts` — `createEncryptionProfile()` and `importEncryptionProfile()` check `findFirst({ where: { name } })` before create; throw descriptive Error on conflict
- Updated `src/app/actions/group.ts` — `createGroup()` and `updateGroup()` check `findUnique({ where: { name } })` before create/update; return `{ success: false, error }` on conflict
- Updated `src/app/api/jobs/route.ts` and `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts` — Error handling now parses error messages and returns HTTP 409 for "already exists" errors instead of generic 500
- Updated `src/components/adapter/adapter-form.tsx` — `saveConfig()` now parses server JSON response and displays `result.error` in toast notification instead of generic "Operation failed"
- Updated `tests/unit/services/encryption-service.test.ts` — Added `findFirst: vi.fn()` to Prisma mock; each test that calls create/import mocks `findFirst` to return `null`
- Updated `tests/unit/services/config-service.complex.test.ts` — `createPrismaDelegate` helper now includes `findFirst` implementation with proper `where` clause matching including `{ not: value }` operator support

## v0.9.9-beta - Storage Alerts, Notification Logs & Restore Improvements
*Released: February 22, 2026*

This release introduces a per-destination storage alert system with deduplication, a full notification log history with adapter-specific previews, a dedicated restore page with version compatibility checks, skeleton loading states, and numerous UI refinements across the Storage and Database Explorers.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🛡️ Backup Compatibility Matrix in Restore Dialog
- **Pre-Restore Version Check** — When selecting a target database source in the Restore dialog, the backup's engine version is now compared against the target server's version immediately — before clicking "Start Restore"
- **Version Mismatch Warning** — If the backup was created on a newer database version than the target server, an orange warning banner appears: "Backup was created on version X, but the target server runs Y"
- **MSSQL Edition Guard** — Incompatible MSSQL editions (Azure SQL Edge ↔ SQL Server) are detected and shown as a red error banner, blocking the restore button entirely
- **Compatibility Confirmation** — When versions are compatible, a green "Version compatible" indicator confirms the match (e.g., "Backup 8.0.32 → Target 8.0.35")
- **Engine Edition in File Details** — The backup file details badge now also displays the engine edition (e.g., "MSSQL 15.0.4405.4 (Azure SQL Edge)") when available
- **Non-Blocking for Warnings** — Version mismatch warnings do not block the restore — users can still proceed at their own risk. Only hard incompatibilities (edition mismatch) disable the button

#### 🔗 MSSQL SSH File Transfer Testing
- **Dedicated SSH Test Button** — New "Test SSH Connection" button in the File Transfer tab when SSH mode is selected
- **Connection Verification** — Tests SSH connectivity to the configured `sshHost` and `sshPort`
- **Backup Path Access Check** — Verifies the configured backup path is accessible and has read/write permissions
- **Write Capability Test** — Creates a temporary probe file, verifies it exists, then cleans it up — confirms the user has write access at the backup location
- **Detailed Error Messages** — Differentiates between connection failures, path not found, read-only, and successful conditions:
  - SSH connection failed → SSH authentication/network error
  - Backup path is not accessible → Directory doesn't exist or permission denied on read
  - Backup path is read-only → Can read but cannot write (insufficient permissions)
  - Backup path is readable and writable → All checks passed ✓
- **Non-Blocking** — Test button doesn't block the form; you can continue configuring even after a failed test

#### 📧 Notification Email Template Redesign (Shadcn/UI Style)
- **Modern Card Layout** — Email notifications now use a clean card-based design with subtle zinc borders and proper spacing, following Shadcn/UI design system
- **Color-Coded Status Badge** — Status indicator shown as a pill badge (✓ Success / ✕ Failed / ℹ Info) in the top-right corner instead of a colored header bar
- **Improved Typography** — Consistent font hierarchy with 18px title, 14px body text, and 12px footer using system font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI"`, etc.)
- **Enhanced Fields Table** — Individual database info rows with left-aligned category labels on subtle gray background and white value cells for better readability
- **Zinc Color Palette** — Uses Shadcn/UI's zinc neutral colors (#09090b foreground, #f4f4f5 subtle backgrounds, #e4e4e7 borders) with status-specific variations (green/red/blue/purple)
- **Clickable Footer Link** — "Sent by DBackup" now links to https://dbackup.app for better branding

#### 📊 Restore Notifications Enhanced with Rich Context
- **Database Type** — Shows the database adapter type (MYSQL, POSTGRES, MONGODB, MSSQL, SQLITE, REDIS)
- **Storage Name** — Displays the storage destination name for better tracking of where backups are stored
- **Backup File** — Shows the backup file name for reference
- **Complete Source Info** — Uses actual adapter names instead of internal IDs, making notifications much more readable
- **Duration Tracking** — Includes total restore duration (in seconds) for performance monitoring
- **Failure Details** — Enhanced error messages provide full error context for easier troubleshooting

#### ⚡ Selective TAR Extraction for Multi-Database Restores
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented `extractSelectedDatabases()` function in `src/lib/adapters/database/common/tar-utils.ts` — only extracts database dump files matching selected databases instead of extracting all entries from the TAR archive
- **Manifest-First Approach**: Reads manifest first to build a lookup set of selected filenames, skips unselected entries via `stream.resume()` without I/O
- **Applies to All Adapters**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MSSQL restore operations now use selective extraction
- **MSSQL Filtering**: MSSQL's `extractTarArchive()` function enhanced to filter `.bak` files by database name (derived from filename)
- **Backward Compatible**: Empty selection list extracts all databases — maintains fallback behavior
- **Benefits**: Significantly reduces disk I/O and temporary storage requirements when restoring only 1 of many databases from a large multi-DB backup (e.g., 100 MB extracted instead of 50 GB)
- **New Unit Tests**: Four comprehensive tests in `tests/unit/adapters/database/common/tar-utils.test.ts` covering single/multiple selective extraction, full extraction fallback, and error handling

#### 🎨 Dedicated Restore Page & Enhanced UI
- **Full-Page Restore Experience** — Moved restore workflow from a modal dialog to a dedicated page at `/dashboard/storage/restore` with unlimited space and better visual hierarchy
- **2-Column Grid Layout** — Left column (2/3 width) shows file details, target database selection, and database mapping table; right column (1/3 width) displays existing databases on target, warnings, and action buttons
- **File Details Card** — Shows backup filename, size, creation date, database type, engine version, edition, compression method, and encryption status with icon-coded badges
- **Target Database Selection** — Dropdown to select which database source to restore to, with automatic version compatibility checking and conflict detection
- **Database Mapping Table** — For multi-database backups, shows a table with Source DB name, target name input, and status badges (Overwrite for existing DBs, New for new DBs) with checkboxes to select which databases to restore
- **Privileged Auth Support** — After failed restore due to insufficient permissions, shows inline form to enter elevated credentials (root/admin user) and retry with higher privileges
- **Existing Databases Sidebar** — Collapsible section on the right showing all databases currently on the target server with sizes and count badges. Databases marked in red if they will be overwritten by the restore
- **Compatibility Checks Live** — When target is selected, fetches server version and runs compatibility checks. Hard incompatibilities (MSSQL edition mismatch) disable the button immediately. Soft warnings (version mismatch) show as orange alert but still allow proceeding
- **URL Parameter State** — FileInfo and destination ID are passed via base64-encoded URL parameters (`?file=...&destinationId=...`) for easy bookmarking and returning to the same restore session
- **System Config Restore** — If restoring a system configuration backup, shows checkboxes for which components to restore (Settings, Adapters, Jobs, Users, SSO, Encryption Profiles)
- **Redis Fallback** — Redis restores (which use a specialized wizard) show a helpful message directing users to use the Storage Explorer button instead
- **Optimized Spacing** — Refined padding and margins throughout for better visual balance — warning alert centered between top and separator, reduced gaps between existing databases header and table

#### 📊 Storage Explorer Tabs & Dedicated History Page
- **Tab Navigation** — Storage Explorer now features three tabs (Explorer, History, Settings) that appear once a destination is selected — enabling quick switching between browsing backups, viewing analytics, and configuring alerts
- **Dedicated History Tab** — Full-page storage history with two side-by-side charts: an area chart for storage size over time and a bar chart for backup count over time — replacing the small modal dialog
- **Stats Overview Cards** — Three summary cards above the charts: Current Size (with delta vs. start of period), Backup Count (with change indicator), and Average Size (across all snapshots in the period)
- **Time Range Selector** — Choose from 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, or 1 year — same as the existing modal but now with more space for the charts
- **Shadcn/UI Charts** — Uses `ChartContainer`, `ChartTooltip`, `ChartTooltipContent` from `@/components/ui/chart` with `recharts` AreaChart and BarChart — proper CSS variable theming for dark/light mode
- **Trend Indicators** — Stats cards show colored up/down arrows (TrendingUp/TrendingDown) with size or count deltas compared to the oldest data point in the selected range
- **Settings Tab (Coming Soon)** — Placeholder tab with planned features: Usage Spike Alerts, Storage Limit Warnings, Missing Backup Alerts, and Anomaly Detection (sudden size increases/decreases) — all marked with "Coming Soon" badges
- **Context-Aware Controls** — "Show System Configs" toggle only visible when the Explorer tab is active — hides when viewing History or Settings
- **Restore Back Navigation** — Returning from the restore page now preserves the previously selected storage destination via `?destination=` URL parameter

#### 🔔 Storage Alert System (Notification Integration)
- **Per-Destination Alert Configuration** — Each storage destination now has its own alert settings in the Settings tab, with individual toggles and thresholds for three alert types
- **Usage Spike Alert** — Detects when total storage size increases or decreases by more than a configurable percentage (default: 50%) between refresh cycles. Compares the latest two storage snapshots
- **Storage Limit Warning** — Alerts when storage usage reaches 90% of a user-configured size limit (e.g., 10 GB). Configurable in MB, GB, or TB with a dropdown unit selector
- **Missing Backup Alert** — Triggers when no new backup files appear within a configurable time window (default: 48 hours, max: 8760h / 1 year). Tracks backup count changes across storage snapshots
- **System Notification Integration** — All three storage alert types are registered as system notification events under a new "Storage" category in Settings > Notifications. Events can be enabled/disabled per channel, and test notifications can be sent for each event type
- **Automatic Alert Checking** — Storage alerts are evaluated automatically during each storage stats refresh cycle (triggered by the "Refresh Storage Statistics" system task and after backups). No additional scheduler or cron job required
- **Notification Templates** — Rich notification payloads with storage name, size values, percentage changes, and timestamps. Compatible with all notification adapters (Email, Discord, Gotify, etc.)
- **Alert Config Persistence** — Per-destination settings stored in `SystemSetting` table with keys like `storage.alerts.<configId>`. Defaults provided for new destinations (all alerts disabled by default)
- **Info Card** — The Settings tab includes a "Notification Delivery" info card explaining that alerts are routed through the global notification channels configured in Settings > Notifications

#### ⏱️ Configurable Data Retention for Storage Snapshots
- **Extended Storage Management** — Storage snapshots are now automatically cleaned up based on a configurable retention policy, complementing the existing audit log retention
- **Granular Retention Options** — Choose from 7 days to 5 years (1825 days) per data type — separate configurable retention periods for Audit Logs and Storage Snapshots
- **Unified Data Retention UI** — New "Data Retention" card in Settings → General with a Popover containing two FormFields (one for Audit Logs, one for Storage Snapshots) with icons for visual clarity
- **Cleanup Automation** — Extended "Clean Old Data" system task runs daily at midnight, automatically removing both old audit logs and outdated storage snapshots based on their configured retention values
- **Human-Readable Display** — Retention values are shown in friendly format: 1–364 days as "Xd", while year-aligned values like 730 days display as "2y", 1095 as "3y", etc. (e.g., button shows "90d / 2y" for 90-day logs and 2-year snapshots)
- **Dynamic Configuration** — Retention periods are stored in the database as SystemSettings and can be updated anytime without restarting — cleanup logic reads current values on each execution
- **Non-Blocking Cleanup** — Each data type (audit logs, snapshots) is cleaned independently with separate error handling, so a failure in one cleanup type doesn't prevent the other from running

#### 📋 Notification Log History
- **Full Notification Audit Trail** — Every notification sent (per-job and system-wide) is now permanently logged in a dedicated `NotificationLog` table with event type, adapter, channel, status, and timestamp
- **History Page Tabs** — The History page now features two tabs: "Activity Logs" (existing execution history) and "Notification Logs" — enabling quick switching between backup activity and notification delivery records
- **Adapter-Specific Previews** — Each log entry can be previewed in a dialog that renders the notification as it would appear on the target platform:
  - **Discord** — Dark-themed embed card with color bar, title, fields grid, and timestamp
  - **Email** — Full HTML render in an isolated iframe using `srcDoc`
  - **Slack** — Block Kit styled preview with header, sections, fields, and context blocks
  - **Telegram** — Chat bubble style with parsed HTML formatting and bot identity
  - **Microsoft Teams** — Adaptive Card preview with FactSet fields, color header, and team styling
  - **Generic** — Plain text fallback for webhook, Gotify, ntfy, SMS adapters showing title, message, and fields
- **Preview Tabs** — Each notification preview dialog includes inner tabs: "Preview" (visual render), "Plain Text" (title + message + fields), and "Raw Payload" (full JSON payload as sent to the adapter)
- **Filterable & Searchable** — Notification log table supports filtering by adapter type, event type (backup success/failure, restore, system events), and status (success/error)
- **Data Retention Integration** — Notification logs are included in the Data Retention system with a configurable retention period (7 days to 5 years, default 90 days). A new "Notification Logs" field with Bell icon appears in the Data Retention popover alongside Audit Logs and Storage Snapshots
- **API Endpoints** — Two new API routes: `GET /api/notification-logs` (paginated list with filters) and `GET /api/notification-logs/[id]` (single entry with full payload)
- **Automatic Logging** — Logging happens transparently in both dispatch points (runner pipeline step 04-completion and system notification service) without requiring adapter changes

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Quick Setup Adapter Selection** — Fixed "Please select an adapter type first" error when clicking "Test Connection" in Quick Setup wizard (Database Source, Storage Destination, Notification steps). The hook now correctly falls back to the `adapterId` prop when the form doesn't include that field
- **Test Connection in Setup** — Test Connection button now works properly in all Quick Setup adapter configuration steps, not just the regular adapter management dialogs

### 🎨 UI Improvements
- **Skeleton Loading States** — Replaced plain text "Loading..." indicators with Shadcn Skeleton placeholders throughout the application: Storage Explorer file table (toolbar + header + 6 row skeletons), Storage History tab (stats cards + chart placeholders), Database Explorer (stats grid + database table rows). Settings tab already had Skeleton loading
- **Tab-Aware Refresh Button** — The refresh button in Storage Explorer now reloads the currently active tab: Explorer reloads the file list, History reloads charts and stats, Settings reloads alert configuration — instead of always refreshing only the file list
- **Unified Explorer Layout** — Database Explorer now matches the Storage Explorer's visual style: naked dropdown selector (no Card wrapper), consistent `w-75` width, and matching refresh button placement next to the dropdown
- **Empty States** — Both Storage Explorer and Database Explorer now show a centered empty state Card with a descriptive icon (HardDrive / Database) and helpful text when no source or destination is selected
- **Storage Alert Deduplication** — Storage alerts (Usage Spike, Storage Limit, Missing Backup) now use state tracking with a 24-hour cooldown to prevent notification flooding. Alerts only fire on first activation or after the cooldown expires, and reset automatically when the condition resolves
- **Email Dark Mode Support** — Email notification templates now include dark mode media queries and meta tags for proper rendering in email clients that support `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
- **ScrollArea Migration** — Replaced custom Radix ScrollArea components with native browser scrollbars across the application for more consistent cross-platform behavior and reduced bundle size
- **Discord Notification Preview** — Fixed field layout rendering in the Discord notification preview dialog to properly display inline fields in a grid

### 🔧 Technical Changes

- Updated `src/components/adapter/use-adapter-connection.tsx` — Fixed `testConnection()` to use `adapterId` prop as fallback when form field is missing (for Quick Setup compatibility)
- Added `Loader2` icon import to `src/components/adapter/form-sections.tsx` — Loading state indicator for SSH test button
- Updated `src/components/adapter/form-sections.tsx` — New `SshConfigSection` component with integrated SSH test button; SSH fields moved from inline to dedicated component for better organization
- Updated `toast` import in `src/components/adapter/form-sections.tsx` — Added to enable SSH test notifications
- Redesigned `src/components/email/system-notification-template.tsx` — Complete visual overhaul using Shadcn/UI design tokens (zinc palette), table-based layout for HTML email compatibility, status badges, and responsive card styling
- Extended `RestoreResultData` interface in `src/lib/notifications/types.ts` — Added `databaseType`, `backupFile`, `storageName`, and `size` fields for richer restore notifications
- Updated restore success/failure templates in `src/lib/notifications/templates.ts` — Enhanced templates to include database type, storage name, backup filename, and file size in notification fields
- Updated `src/services/restore-service.ts` — Restore notification calls now pass resolved adapter names and additional metadata (database type, storage name, backup file, file size, duration) instead of just IDs
- Updated unit tests in `tests/unit/lib/notifications/email-template.test.tsx` — Fixed email template tests to account for new table-based layout structure
- Updated unit tests in `tests/unit/adapters/notification/email.test.ts` — Fixed email footer assertions to check for component parts instead of exact concatenation
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/storage/storage-client.tsx` — Added Shadcn `Tabs` (Explorer, History, Settings) with conditional rendering; "Show System Configs" toggle only visible in Explorer tab; added `useSearchParams` for `?destination=` pre-selection when returning from restore page
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/storage/page.tsx` — Wrapped `StorageClient` in `<Suspense>` boundary (required for `useSearchParams` in Next.js App Router)
- New `src/components/dashboard/storage/storage-history-tab.tsx` — Full-page storage history with stats cards (Current Size, Backup Count, Average Size), side-by-side AreaChart (storage size) and BarChart (backup count) using Shadcn/UI Chart components, time range selector (7d–1y), trend indicators
- New `src/components/dashboard/storage/storage-settings-tab.tsx` — Coming Soon placeholder with Storage Alerts (Usage Spike, Storage Limit, Missing Backup) and Anomaly Detection (Sudden Size Increase/Decrease) — all disabled with opacity overlay and "Coming Soon" badges
- New `src/app/dashboard/storage/restore/page.tsx` — Server component for the dedicated restore page, checks `PERMISSIONS.STORAGE.RESTORE` and redirects to `/dashboard/storage` if denied
- New `src/app/dashboard/storage/restore/restore-client.tsx` — Full-page client component (~850 lines) with 2-column grid layout: left column for file details/target selection/database mapping, right column for existing databases sidebar and action buttons. Handles FileInfo parsing from base64 URL params, version compatibility checks, multi-database mapping with selective extraction flags, privileged auth retry flow, system config restore options, and Redis fallback messaging
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/storage/storage-client.tsx` — Removed `RestoreDialog` import and usage; changed restore button to navigate via `router.push()` with base64-encoded FileInfo and destination ID in URL params instead of opening modal; removed database sources state and API fetch since restore page handles fetching

#### 🚀 Quick Setup Wizard
- **Guided First-Run Experience** — New step-by-step setup wizard at `/dashboard/setup` guiding new users through creating their first backup — from database source to running the first job
- **7 Steps** — Welcome → Database Source → Storage Destination → Vault Key (optional) → Notification (optional) → Backup Job → Complete
- **Inline Adapter Forms** — Each step embeds the full adapter picker and configuration form directly in the wizard — no dialogs, no page navigation
- **Connection Testing** — Database source and storage destination steps include "Test Connection" before saving to catch misconfigurations early
- **Vault Key Creation** — Optional step to create an encryption profile for encrypted backups — skippable if not needed or no permission
- **Notification Setup** — Optional step to configure a notification channel (Discord, Slack, Email, etc.) — skippable

### 🎨 UI Improvements

#### 🗂️ Grouped Sidebar Navigation
- **Section Labels** — Sidebar navigation is now organized into four labeled sections for better discoverability: **General** (Overview, Quick Setup), **Backup** (Sources, Destinations, Jobs, Notifications), **Explorer** (Storage Explorer, Database Explorer, History), and **Administration** (Vault, Users & Groups, Settings)
- **Cleaner Layout** — Groups are visually separated with `space-y-6` spacing and subtle uppercase section headings
- **Automatic Group Hiding** — Groups with no visible items (due to missing permissions) are automatically hidden entirely

#### 📊 Dashboard Stats Labels Clarification
- **Backups Widget Subtitle** — Changed from "Total successful backups" to "Across all destinations" to clarify that the widget displays currently existing backup files on storage destinations, not cumulative successful execution records. This improves consistency with the "Total Storage" widget subtitle

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Config Backup Scheduler Not Refreshing**: Enabling or disabling Automated Configuration Backup in Settings now takes effect immediately without requiring a server restart — `scheduler.refresh()` is called after saving the settings
- **Storage History Button Visible Without Permission**: The Storage History action button in the Destinations table was always shown for all users, even when they lacked `storage:read` permission — it now only renders if the user has `storage:read`
- **Health History Popover Visible Without Permission**: The health status badge in Sources/Destinations tables was always clickable and opened the health history popover, regardless of permissions — users without `sources:read` (Sources) or `destinations:read` (Destinations) now see a non-interactive status badge only
- **Health History API Rejected Destination Users**: `GET /api/adapters/[id]/health-history` only accepted `sources:read`, causing users with `destinations:read` (but not `sources:read`) to receive a 403 error when hovering over a destination status badge — the API now accepts either `sources:read` or `destinations:read`

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Updated `src/app/actions/config-backup-settings.ts` — Added `scheduler.refresh()` call after saving config backup settings to immediately apply enabled/disabled state to the cron scheduler
- New `src/app/dashboard/setup/page.tsx` — Server Component entry point for the Quick Setup wizard with permission checks
- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/setup-wizard.tsx` — Main wizard container with step navigation, sidebar progress indicator, and `WizardData` context tracking created resource IDs
- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/welcome-step.tsx` — Welcome overview with dynamic step list based on permissions
- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/source-step.tsx` — Database source creation with adapter picker, form, and connection test

- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/vault-step.tsx` — Optional encryption profile creation step
- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/notification-step.tsx` — Optional notification channel creation step
- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/job-step.tsx` — Backup job creation with cron presets, auto-filled references to previously created resources
- New `src/components/dashboard/setup/steps/complete-step.tsx` — Summary and "Run First Backup Now" button
- Updated `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` — Refactored flat `sidebarItems` array into grouped `sidebarGroups: SidebarGroup[]` structure with four sections (General, Backup, Explorer, Administration). Each group renders its own section label; groups with no visible items are skipped entirely
- Updated `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` — Added Quick Setup entry with `Rocket` icon and `showQuickSetup` prop for conditional visibility
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — Queries source count and `general.showQuickSetup` SystemSetting to determine sidebar visibility
- Updated `src/components/adapter/adapter-form.tsx` — Added `onBack` prop and "← Change Type" button in footer for returning to the adapter picker
- Updated `src/components/adapter/adapter-manager.tsx` — Wired `onBack` callback to navigate from form back to picker dialog
- Updated `src/app/actions/settings.ts` — Added `showQuickSetup` field to the settings schema and upsert logic (`general.showQuickSetup` SystemSetting key)
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` — Loads `general.showQuickSetup` setting and passes to `SystemSettingsForm`
- Updated `src/components/settings/system-settings-form.tsx` — New "Quick Setup Wizard" card with "Always Show Quick Setup" switch in the General tab
- Updated `src/components/adapter/types.ts` — Added `permissions?: string[]` prop to `AdapterManagerProps`
- Updated `src/components/adapter/adapter-manager.tsx` — Accepts `permissions` prop; Storage History button is now gated behind `PERMISSIONS.STORAGE.READ`; `HealthStatusBadge` receives `interactive={false}` when user lacks the required permission (`sources:read` for database adapters, `destinations:read` for storage adapters)
- Updated `src/components/ui/health-status-badge.tsx` — Added `interactive?: boolean` prop (default `true`); when `false`, renders a plain non-clickable badge without the popover
- Updated `src/app/dashboard/destinations/page.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/sources/page.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx` — Pass `permissions` array to `AdapterManager`
- Updated `src/app/api/adapters/[id]/health-history/route.ts` — Replaced single `checkPermissionWithContext(ctx, PERMISSIONS.SOURCES.READ)` with an explicit check accepting either `sources:read` or `destinations:read`

### 🔄 Changes
- Updated README and documentation to list all 7 notification channels as supported
- Notification adapter picker now shows Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Generic Webhook alongside Discord and Email

## v0.9.7-beta - API Keys, Webhook Triggers, Adapter Picker & Brand Icons
*Released: February 20, 2026*

This release introduces API key authentication for programmatic access, webhook triggers for starting backup jobs via REST API, and a visual adapter picker for creating new sources, destinations, and notifications. The picker displays all available adapters as cards with brand icons, grouped by category with tabs for quick navigation. A comprehensive API reference documentation covers all 43 endpoints.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🎯 Visual Adapter Picker
- **Two-Step Create Flow**: Clicking "Add New" now opens a visual picker dialog first, then transitions to the configuration form with the selected type pre-filled
- **Card Grid Layout**: All available adapters are displayed as clickable cards with icons in a responsive 3–4 column grid
- **Search Bar**: Type to filter adapters by name — shown automatically when more than 6 adapters are available. When searching with tabs active, results collapse into a flat filtered grid
- **Category Tabs**: Storage destinations are organized into tabs (All, Local, Cloud Storage (S3), Cloud Drives, Network) for quick filtering
- **Flat Grid Fallback**: Database sources and notification channels (which have no groups) display as a simple flat grid without tabs
- **Read-Only Type Badge**: After selecting an adapter in the picker, the form shows the type as a non-editable badge instead of a dropdown
- **Edit Flow Unchanged**: Editing existing configurations still opens the form directly with the full type dropdown

#### 🎨 Brand Icons for Adapters
- **Iconify Integration**: Replaced `@icons-pack/react-simple-icons` with [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) for richer, multi-colored brand icons — bundled offline (no API calls) for self-hosted deployments
- **SVG Logos (Primary)**: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Discord — all with original multi-colored brand artwork
- **Simple Icons (Fallback)**: MSSQL, Hetzner, MinIO — monochrome icons with brand colors for brands not available in SVG Logos
- **Material Design Icons (Protocols)**: SSH (SFTP), swap-vertical (FTP), cloud-upload (WebDAV), folder-network (SMB), folder-sync (Rsync), harddisk (Local) — descriptive protocol-specific icons instead of generic shapes
- **Lucide (Fallback)**: Mail (Email), Disc (unknown adapters) — for remaining generic icons
- **Proper Brand Icons**: OneDrive and Amazon S3 now display their actual brand logos instead of generic Cloud icons
- **AdapterIcon Component**: New `<AdapterIcon>` component handles icon rendering, color mapping, and pack selection automatically
- **Icon System Docs**: New [Icon System](/developer-guide/core/icons) developer guide documenting architecture, icon packs, and how to add icons for new adapters

#### 🗂️ Grouped Destination Type Selector
- **Categorized Adapter List**: The destination type dropdown now groups storage adapters into logical categories for better discoverability
- **Four Groups**: Local, Cloud Storage (S3), Cloud Drives, and Network — each displayed as a labeled section with a heading
- **Wider Popover**: The dropdown is now wider when groups are present to accommodate category headings
- **Adapter Reordering**: Storage adapters are reordered to match their category grouping (e.g., all S3 variants together, all network protocols together)
- **Backward Compatible**: Database and notification adapters without groups continue to display as a flat list

#### 📡 MSSQL SSH File Transfer
- **Remote Server Support**: MSSQL backups now support SSH/SFTP file transfer for accessing `.bak` files on remote SQL Server hosts — no shared filesystem (Docker volume) required
- **Two Transfer Modes**: Choose between **Local** (shared volume / Docker mount) and **SSH** (SFTP download/upload) in the new **File Transfer** tab
- **Backup Flow**: SQL Server writes `.bak` to `backupPath` on the server → DBackup downloads via SFTP → processes (compress/encrypt) → uploads to storage destination
- **Restore Flow**: DBackup downloads backup from storage → uploads `.bak` to server via SFTP → SQL Server restores from `backupPath` → cleanup
- **Three Auth Methods**: Password, SSH Private Key (PEM), and SSH Agent authentication
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remote `.bak` files are deleted after successful transfer in both backup and restore operations
- **Multi-Database Support**: Works with TAR-archived multi-database backups — individual `.bak` files are transferred per database

#### 🔒 MSSQL Connection Security
- **Encrypt Toggle**: Encryption setting (`encrypt`) now exposed in the UI Configuration tab — enable for Azure SQL or production environments
- **Trust Server Certificate**: Self-signed certificate toggle (`trustServerCertificate`) now accessible in the UI — resolves "Certificate error" when connecting to development/internal SQL Servers

#### 📊 Database Stats in Restore Dialog
- **Existing Databases Overview**: After selecting a target source in the Restore dialog, a collapsible section "Existing Databases on Target" appears showing all user databases on that server
- **Size & Table Count**: Each database displays its total size (data + index) and number of tables/collections
- **Conflict Detection**: Databases that would be overwritten by the restore are highlighted in red with a ⚠️ warning tooltip
- **Total Summary**: Footer row shows total database count and combined size across all databases
- **Async Loading**: Stats are fetched in the background with skeleton loading states — non-blocking for the restore workflow

#### 🔌 New `getDatabasesWithStats()` Adapter Method
- **New Interface**: `DatabaseInfo` type with `name`, `sizeInBytes?`, and `tableCount?` fields added to `BaseAdapter`
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: Queries `information_schema.schemata` + `information_schema.tables` for size (data_length + index_length) and table count
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses `pg_database_size()` function + `information_schema.tables` count
- **MongoDB**: Now leverages the native `sizeOnDisk` from `listDatabases` command (previously discarded) + `listCollections()` for collection count
- **MSSQL**: Queries `sys.master_files` for file sizes + `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` for table count
- **Graceful Fallback**: If `getDatabasesWithStats()` is not implemented, falls back to `getDatabases()` (names only)

#### 🔍 Database Explorer Page
- **Standalone Page**: New dedicated page at `/dashboard/explorer` for browsing databases on any configured source — accessible from the sidebar
- **Searchable Source Selector**: Combobox with type-ahead filtering to quickly find sources by name or adapter type
- **Server Overview Cards**: Three summary widgets showing server type + version, database count, and total storage size
- **Database Table**: Sortable table with database name, size, table/collection count, and a visual size distribution bar
- **Deep Link from Sources**: New inspect button (🔍) on each database source in the Sources table — navigates directly to the Database Explorer with the source pre-selected
- **URL Parameter Support**: Accepts `?sourceId=...` query parameter for direct linking — auto-selects and loads the specified source on page load

#### 🔢 Port Placeholders
- **MSSQL**: Default port `1433` shown as placeholder
- **Redis**: Default port `6379` shown as placeholder
- **MariaDB**: Default port `3306` shown as placeholder

#### ✅ Environment Variable Validation
- **Startup Check**: All required and optional environment variables are validated at application startup using Zod schemas
- **Clear Error Messages**: Missing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` produces a formatted error box with generation instructions and a link to the installation docs
- **Graceful Warnings**: Invalid optional variables (e.g., malformed `BETTER_AUTH_URL`) are logged as warnings without blocking startup
- **Default Values**: Optional variables like `LOG_LEVEL`, `TZ`, `PORT`, and `DATABASE_URL` have documented defaults applied automatically

#### 🔑 API Key Management
- **Programmatic Access**: Create API keys with fine-grained permissions to authenticate against the REST API using `Authorization: Bearer dbackup_xxx` headers
- **Scoped Permissions**: Each API key has individually assigned permissions — SuperAdmin privileges are never inherited, only explicitly granted permissions apply
- **Key Lifecycle**: Full CRUD management — create, view, toggle (enable/disable), rotate (regenerate), and delete API keys
- **Secure Storage**: Only the first 16 characters (`dbackup_` prefix) are stored in the database. The full key is shown exactly once upon creation and cannot be retrieved afterward
- **Expiration Dates**: Optional expiry date with Shadcn Calendar date picker — expired keys are automatically rejected during authentication
- **Audit Trail**: API key creation, rotation, toggle, and deletion are logged in the audit trail with the key name and prefix
- **One-Time Reveal Dialog**: After creation, a dedicated dialog displays the full API key with a copy button and a warning that it won't be shown again
- **Users Page Integration**: New "API Keys" tab on the Access Management page (requires `api-keys:read` or `api-keys:write` permission)

#### 🔗 Webhook Triggers (API-Based Job Execution)
- **Trigger Backups via API**: Start any backup job remotely by sending a `POST /api/jobs/:id/run` request with a valid API key
- **Execution Polling**: Poll job progress via `GET /api/executions/:id` with optional `?includeLogs=true` for real-time status updates
- **API Trigger Dialog**: New "API Trigger" button (🔗) on each backup job showing ready-to-use code examples in three tabs:
  - **cURL**: Simple one-liner for quick terminal usage
  - **Bash**: Full script with polling loop, status checks, and exit codes
  - **Ansible**: Complete playbook with `uri` module and async polling via `until` loop
- **Clipboard Copy**: Each code example has a one-click copy button
- **Queue Integration**: API-triggered jobs go through the same FIFO queue as scheduled/manual jobs — respects `maxConcurrentJobs` concurrency limit
- **Audit Logging**: API-triggered executions record `trigger: "api"` and the API key ID in the audit log

#### 🔐 Unified Authentication System
- **Dual Auth Support**: All API routes now support both session-based (browser cookie) and API key (Bearer token) authentication via a unified `getAuthContext()` function
- **Auth Context**: New `AuthContext` type carries `userId`, `permissions[]`, and `authMethod` ("session" or "apikey") — used consistently across all route handlers
- **Middleware Rate Limiting**: API key requests are subject to the existing rate limiter (100 GET/min, 20 POST/min per IP)
- **Route Migration**: All 17+ API route handlers migrated from `auth.api.getSession()` to `getAuthContext()` for consistent auth handling

#### 📋 Execution Polling Endpoint
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/executions/:id` returns execution status, progress percentage, current stage, timing, file size, and error details
- **Optional Logs**: Pass `?includeLogs=true` to include full execution log entries
- **Permission Check**: Requires `history:read` permission

#### 🧩 Reusable Permission Picker
- **Extracted Component**: Permission selection UI extracted from the Groups form into a standalone `<PermissionPicker>` component
- **Dual Usage**: Used in both the Group edit form (`onPermissionChange` mode) and the API Key create dialog (`react-hook-form` mode)
- **Grouped Layout**: Permissions are displayed in categorized groups (Jobs, Storage, Sources, etc.) with "Select All" / "Deselect All" per group

#### 🐳 Docker Health Check
- **Built-in HEALTHCHECK**: Dockerfile now includes a `HEALTHCHECK` directive that polls `/api/health` every 30 seconds
- **Health Endpoint**: New `GET /api/health` API route (unauthenticated) returning app status, database connectivity, uptime, memory usage, and response time
- **Docker Status Integration**: `docker ps` now shows `healthy` / `unhealthy` status, and orchestrators (Docker Compose, Kubernetes) can use it for automated restarts
- **503 on Failure**: Returns HTTP 503 with `"status": "unhealthy"` when the database is unreachable

#### ⚡ Configurable Rate Limits
- **Per-Category Limits**: Configure separate rate limits for Authentication (login attempts), API Read (GET requests), and API Write (POST/PUT/DELETE mutations) — all adjustable from the Settings page
- **Auto-Save UI**: New "Rate Limits" tab in Settings with three cards showing Max Requests and Time Window inputs per category — changes auto-save with 800ms debounce, matching the existing settings UX
- **Reset to Defaults**: One-click reset button restores all rate limits to their default values (Auth: 5/60s, API: 100/60s, Mutation: 20/60s)
- **Persistent Configuration**: Rate limit values are stored in the `SystemSetting` database table and survive server restarts
- **Edge Runtime Architecture**: Middleware fetches rate limit config from an internal API endpoint (`/api/internal/rate-limit-config`) with a 30-second TTL cache — avoids the Edge Runtime limitation where Prisma cannot be used directly
- **Immediate Enforcement**: After saving new rate limits, the middleware picks up the updated config within 30 seconds (or immediately on next cache expiry)

#### 🛑 Graceful Shutdown
- **SIGTERM/SIGINT Handling**: The application now catches shutdown signals and performs a clean shutdown sequence instead of hard-killing running processes
- **Wait for Running Backups**: On shutdown, the app waits **indefinitely** for all running backup/restore executions to complete — no arbitrary timeout that could kill a long-running backup
- **Queue Freeze**: The queue manager immediately stops picking up new jobs when a shutdown signal is received
- **Scheduler Stop**: All cron-scheduled jobs are stopped immediately to prevent new triggers during shutdown
- **Pending Job Cleanup**: Any pending (not yet started) jobs in the queue are marked as `Failed` since they won't be picked up after shutdown
- **Database Cleanup**: Prisma client is gracefully disconnected before process exit
- **Force Exit**: Sending a second signal (e.g., Ctrl+C twice) forces immediate exit for emergency situations

#### ⚙️ Configurable Rate Limits (Technical)
- **Internal API Endpoint**: New `GET /api/internal/rate-limit-config` endpoint serving current rate limit config from DB — consumed by Edge Runtime middleware via `fetch()` with 30s TTL cache
- **Edge-Safe Architecture**: Middleware never imports Prisma — fetches config via HTTP from the Node.js runtime, avoiding the `PrismaClient is not configured to run in Edge Runtime` error
- **Three Rate Limit Categories**: Authentication (login), API Read (GET/HEAD), API Write (POST/PUT/DELETE) — each with configurable `points` (max requests) and `duration` (window in seconds)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Mouse Wheel Scrolling**: Fixed mouse wheel scrolling not working in command list dropdowns (type selector, comboboxes). The `cmdk` library was intercepting scroll events — added a manual `onWheel` handler to `CommandList` to ensure native scroll behavior
- **Conditional Form Fields**: Fixed fields appearing before their controlling dropdown is selected (e.g., SSH password shown before auth method is chosen, local backup path shown before transfer mode is selected). Applied to both MSSQL File Transfer and SQLite SSH Connection forms

## v0.9.6-beta - Rsync, Google Drive, Dropbox & OneDrive Storage Destinations & New Notification System
*Released: February 15, 2026*

This release adds Rsync as a new storage destination for efficient incremental file transfers over SSH, and Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive as cloud providers with full OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔔 System Notifications
- **System-Wide Event Alerts**: New notification framework for events beyond individual backup jobs — user logins, account creation, restore results, configuration backups, and system errors
- **Settings UI**: New **Notifications** tab in Settings with global channel selection, per-event toggles, channel overrides, and test buttons
- **Event Categories**: Six configurable system events across four categories (Authentication, Restore, System) — each with independent enable/disable and channel assignment
- **Global & Per-Event Channels**: Set default notification channels globally, then optionally override channels for specific events (e.g., Discord for logins, Email for errors)
- **Notify User Directly**: For login and account creation events, optionally send a direct email to the affected user — three modes: Disabled (admin only), Admin & User, or User only
- **Unified Template System**: All notifications (per-job and system) now use the same `renderTemplate()` pipeline with adapter-agnostic payloads, ensuring consistent formatting across Discord embeds and HTML emails
- **Single Email Template**: Replaced the legacy backup-only email template with a unified `SystemNotificationEmail` React component used for all notification types
- **No Duplicate Notifications**: Backup success/failure events are intentionally excluded from system notifications (configured per-job only) to prevent double alerts
- **Fire-and-Forget**: System notifications never block the calling operation — all errors are logged but never thrown

#### 📧 Multi-Recipient Email Notifications
- **Multiple Recipients**: Email notification channels now support multiple recipients — add as many email addresses as needed per channel
- **Tag Input UI**: New chip/tag-style input field for the "To" field — type an email address and press Enter, Tab, comma, or Space to add it as a tag
- **Remove Recipients**: Click the X button on any tag to remove a recipient
- **Paste Support**: Paste comma- or semicolon-separated email lists and they are automatically split into individual tags
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing single-email configurations continue to work without changes

#### 🧹 Notification Table Cleanup
- **Removed Status Column**: The health check status column ("Pending") is no longer shown for notification adapters, as connection health monitoring is not applicable to notification channels (Discord webhooks, SMTP)

#### ☁️ Google Drive Storage Destination
- **New Cloud Adapter**: Store backups directly in Google Drive — the first cloud provider in DBackup with native OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: One-click authorization in the UI — redirects to Google's consent screen, automatically stores refresh token (encrypted at rest)
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Uses refresh tokens with auto-renewal — no manual re-authorization required
- **Folder Management**: Optional target folder ID or automatic root-level storage — creates subfolder hierarchies as needed
- **Visual Folder Browser**: Browse and select target folders directly from Google Drive — navigable dialog with breadcrumbs, single-click select, double-click navigate
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload/download progress with resumable media uploads for large backup files
- **Connection Testing**: Verifies OAuth tokens, Drive API access, and folder permissions before creating jobs

#### ☁️ Dropbox Storage Destination
- **New Cloud Adapter**: Store backups directly in Dropbox with native OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: One-click authorization in the UI — redirects to Dropbox's consent screen, automatically stores refresh token (encrypted at rest)
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Dropbox SDK handles token renewal automatically — no manual re-authorization required
- **Folder Path**: Optional target folder path (e.g. `/backups`) — creates subfolder hierarchies as needed
- **Visual Folder Browser**: Browse and select target folders directly from Dropbox — navigable dialog with breadcrumbs
- **Large File Support**: Chunked session uploads for files > 150 MB (up to 350 GB per file)
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Verifies OAuth tokens, account access, and write/delete permissions before creating jobs

#### ☁️ Microsoft OneDrive Storage Destination
- **New Cloud Adapter**: Store backups directly in Microsoft OneDrive via OAuth 2.0 using the Microsoft Graph API
- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: One-click authorization in the UI — redirects to Microsoft's consent screen, automatically stores refresh token (encrypted at rest)
- **Personal & Organizational Accounts**: Works with both personal Microsoft accounts (Outlook, Hotmail) and Microsoft 365 / Azure AD organizational accounts
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Uses refresh tokens with auto-renewal — no manual re-authorization required
- **Folder Path**: Optional target folder path (e.g., `/DBackup`) — creates subfolder hierarchies as needed
- **Visual Folder Browser**: Browse and select target folders directly from OneDrive — navigable dialog with breadcrumbs
- **Smart Upload Strategy**: Simple PUT for files ≤ 4 MB, chunked upload sessions with 10 MB chunks for larger files
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Verifies OAuth tokens, OneDrive access, folder permissions, and write/delete operations before creating jobs

#### 📡 Rsync (SSH) Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on any remote server using rsync over SSH — leverages rsync's delta-transfer algorithm for efficient incremental syncs
- **Three Auth Methods**: Password (via `sshpass`), SSH Private Key (PEM format), and SSH Agent authentication — matching SFTP's auth options
- **Delta Transfer**: Only changed blocks are transferred, significantly reducing bandwidth for recurring backups to the same destination
- **Compression**: Built-in transfer compression (`-z` flag) reduces network usage during upload and download
- **Custom Options**: Optional field for additional rsync flags (e.g., `--bwlimit`, `--timeout`, `--exclude`)
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

### 🔒 Security
- **OAuth Refresh Token Encryption**: Refresh tokens and client secrets are encrypted at rest using `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (added to `SENSITIVE_KEYS`)
- **No Token Exposure**: Access tokens are never stored — generated on-the-fly from encrypted refresh tokens
- **Scoped Access**: Uses `drive.file` scope for backup operations (only access files DBackup created) and `drive.readonly` for folder browsing (navigate existing folders to select a target)
- **No Plaintext Passwords**: Rsync passwords are never passed as command-line arguments — uses `SSHPASS` environment variable exclusively
- **Sanitized Error Messages**: All error output is sanitized to strip commands, credentials, and SSH warnings before displaying to users
- **SSH Options Hardening**: Password auth disables public key authentication to prevent SSH agent interference (`PreferredAuthentications=password`, `PubkeyAuthentication=no`)

### ⚡ Performance
- **Cached Storage Statistics**: Dashboard no longer queries cloud storage APIs (Dropbox, Google Drive, S3, etc.) on every page load — storage volume data is cached in the database and served instantly
- **New System Task "Refresh Storage Statistics"**: Periodically refreshes storage file counts and sizes from all destinations (default: every hour). Configurable in Settings → System Tasks
- **Auto-Refresh After Changes**: Storage cache is automatically updated after each successful backup, retention cleanup, and manual file deletion in the Storage Explorer
- **Parallel Adapter Queries**: Storage statistics refresh now queries all adapters in parallel instead of sequentially — significantly faster with multiple destinations
- **Eliminated Duplicate Calls**: Fixed `getStorageVolume()` being called twice per dashboard page load (once directly, once via `getDashboardStats()`)

### 📊 Storage Usage History
- **Historical Storage Charts**: Click any storage destination on the dashboard to open a detailed usage history chart — shows how storage size has changed over days, weeks, or months
- **Configurable Time Range**: Select from 7 days to 1 year to analyze storage growth trends
- **Area Chart Visualization**: Smooth area chart with gradient fill showing storage size over time
- **Storage Delta**: Displays the change in storage size compared to the start of the selected period (e.g., "+1.2 GB vs 30d ago")
- **Automatic Data Collection**: Storage snapshots are recorded at each scheduled stats refresh (default: hourly) — no additional configuration needed
- **Snapshot Retention**: Old snapshots are automatically cleaned up after 90 days to prevent database bloat

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Dashboard Layout**: Fixed Job Status chart stretching to match Storage Usage card height when many destinations are configured
- **Adapter Details Column**: Fixed missing details display for OneDrive (`folderPath`), MariaDB, and MSSQL (`user@host:port`) in the Sources and Destinations tables

## v0.9.5-beta - Dashboard Overhaul, Checksums & Visual Analytics
*Released: February 13, 2026*

This release introduces a completely redesigned dashboard with interactive charts, real-time statistics, and auto-refresh capabilities. It also adds SHA-256 checksum verification throughout the backup lifecycle for end-to-end data integrity. The dashboard now provides a comprehensive at-a-glance overview of backup health, job activity, and storage usage. Sources, Destinations, and Notifications pages now feature smart type filters for quick navigation.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔒 SHA-256 Checksum Verification
- **Backup Pipeline Integration**: Every backup now calculates a SHA-256 checksum of the final file (after compression/encryption) and stores it in the `.meta.json` sidecar file
- **Post-Upload Verification (Local Storage)**: For local filesystem storage, the backup is re-downloaded and its checksum verified after upload. Remote storage (S3, SFTP, etc.) relies on transport-level integrity checks to avoid costly re-downloads of large files
- **Restore Verification**: Before decryption/decompression, the downloaded backup file's checksum is verified against the stored value — aborts restore if mismatch detected
- **Integrity Check System Task**: New periodic system task (`system.integrity_check`) that verifies all backups across all storage destinations. Runs weekly (Sunday 4 AM), disabled by default
- **IntegrityService**: New service that iterates all storage configs, downloads each backup, and verifies checksums — reports total files, verified, passed, failed, and skipped counts

#### 🔍 Smart Type Filters
- **Sources Page**: Faceted filter to narrow sources by database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- **Destinations Page**: Faceted filter to narrow destinations by storage type (Local, S3, SFTP, etc.)
- **Notifications Page**: Faceted filter to narrow notifications by adapter type
- **Dynamic Options**: Filter only shows types that have at least one entry — no empty options cluttering the UI
- **Auto-Hide**: Filter button is hidden entirely when all entries are the same type or only one entry exists

#### 📊 Interactive Dashboard Charts
- **Activity Chart**: New stacked bar chart showing backup and restore executions over the last 14 days, grouped by status (Completed, Failed, Running, Pending)
- **Job Status Distribution**: Donut chart visualizing the status distribution of all executions in the last 30 days, with success rate percentage displayed in the center
- **Recharts Integration**: Added Recharts via the official shadcn/ui Chart component for consistent, accessible chart rendering

#### 📈 Expanded Stats Cards
- **7 KPI Cards**: Dashboard now shows Total Jobs, Active Schedules, Backups, Total Storage, Success Rate, 24h Successful, and 24h Failed at a glance
- **Visual Indicators**: Each card includes an icon and descriptive subtitle for quick orientation

#### 🗂️ Latest Jobs Widget
- **Live Activity Feed**: New widget showing recent backup and restore executions with status badges and relative timestamps
- **Type Filter**: Dropdown filter to show All, Backup-only, or Restore-only executions
- **Source Icons**: Database type icons (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) displayed alongside job names

#### 🔄 Auto-Refresh
- **Smart Polling**: Dashboard automatically refreshes every 3 seconds while backup or restore jobs are running
- **Auto-Stop**: Polling stops automatically when all jobs complete, with one final refresh to update the view
- **Zero Config**: No user interaction needed — refresh activates and deactivates based on job state

#### 💾 Storage Overview
- **Per-Destination Breakdown**: Storage widget lists each configured storage destination with backup count and total size
- **Live File Scanning**: Storage sizes are calculated from actual files via storage adapters (not just database records)
- **Total Summary**: Aggregated total row shown when multiple storage destinations are configured

#### 🌐 WebDAV Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on any WebDAV-compatible server — Nextcloud, ownCloud, Synology WebDAV, Apache (mod_dav), Nginx, or any other WebDAV endpoint
- **HTTPS Support**: Encrypted file transfers over standard HTTP/HTTPS — no special ports or protocols needed
- **No CLI Dependency**: Uses the `webdav` npm package directly — no system-level tools required (unlike SMB)
- **Path Prefix**: Optional subdirectory for organized backup storage
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

#### 📂 SMB / Samba Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on SMB/CIFS network shares — Windows file servers, NAS devices (Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS), and Linux Samba servers
- **Protocol Support**: Configurable SMB protocol version (SMB3, SMB2, NT1) with SMB3 as default for encryption support
- **Domain Authentication**: Supports workgroup and Active Directory domain authentication
- **Path Prefix**: Optional subdirectory on the share for organized backup storage
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

#### 📡 FTP / FTPS Storage Destination
- **New Storage Adapter**: Store backups on any FTP server with optional TLS encryption — shared hosting, legacy infrastructure, and classic file servers
- **Explicit FTPS Support**: Optional TLS encryption (AUTH TLS on port 21) for secure file transfers — plain FTP available but not recommended for production
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with virtually any hosting provider without CLI dependencies — uses the `basic-ftp` npm package directly
- **Anonymous & Authenticated Access**: Supports both anonymous FTP and username/password authentication
- **Path Prefix**: Optional remote directory for organized backup storage
- **Full Lifecycle**: Upload, download, list, delete, and read operations for complete backup management including retention policies
- **Connection Testing**: Write/delete verification test ensures proper permissions before creating jobs

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Accurate Backup Sizes**: Fixed backup file size tracking to reflect the actual compressed and encrypted file size instead of the raw database dump size
- **DateDisplay Crash**: Fixed a crash when using relative date formatting by switching to `formatDistanceToNow` from date-fns

## v0.9.4-beta - Universal Download Links & Logging System
*Released: February 6, 2026*

This release extends the token-based download link feature (introduced for Redis restore) to all backup downloads in Storage Explorer. Additionally, it introduces a centralized logging and error handling system for better maintainability and debugging.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔗 wget/curl Download Links for All Backups
The temporary download link feature is now available for all backup files:
- **Universal Access**: Click the Download button on any backup file and select "wget / curl Link"
- **Download Format Selection**: Choose between encrypted (.enc) or decrypted download for encrypted backups
- **Live Countdown Timer**: See exactly how much time remains before the link expires
- **Reusable Modal**: New `DownloadLinkModal` component can be integrated anywhere in the app
- **Ready-to-Use Commands**: Pre-formatted wget and curl commands with one-click copy

#### 🎯 Improved Download UX
- All files now show a dropdown menu on the Download button (not just encrypted files)
- Consistent download experience across all backup types
- wget/curl option always available regardless of encryption status

#### 📝 Centralized Logging System
Introduced a unified logging infrastructure to replace scattered `console.log` calls:
- **System Logger**: New `logger` utility (`src/lib/logger.ts`) with level-based logging (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Child Loggers**: Context-aware logging with `logger.child({ service: "ServiceName" })` for better traceability
- **Environment Control**: Configure log level via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- **Output Formats**: Human-readable colored output in development, JSON format in production
- **Custom Error Classes**: New error hierarchy (`src/lib/errors.ts`) with specialized errors for adapters, services, encryption, etc.
- **Error Utilities**: `wrapError()`, `getErrorMessage()`, `isDBackupError()` for consistent error handling

#### 🌐 API Request & Security Logging
Added comprehensive logging in the Next.js middleware:
- **Request Logging**: All API requests are logged with method, path, duration, and anonymized IP
- **Rate Limit Events**: Warnings logged when clients exceed rate limits (for security monitoring)
- **IP Anonymization**: IPs are anonymized in logs for GDPR compliance (e.g., `192.168.x.x`)
- **Silent Paths**: High-frequency endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/get-session`) excluded to reduce noise

#### 🛡️ Type-Safe Error Handling
New custom error classes for better error categorization:
- `DBackupError` (base class)
- `AdapterError`, `ConnectionError`, `ConfigurationError`
- `ServiceError`, `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`
- `PermissionError`, `AuthenticationError`
- `BackupError`, `RestoreError`, `EncryptionError`, `QueueError`

### 📚 Documentation
- Added comprehensive developer documentation for Download Tokens system
- Updated Storage Explorer user guide with wget/curl download section
- **New**: Added Logging System documentation in Developer Guide (System Logger, Custom Errors, Best Practices)

### 🧹 Code Cleanup
Removed legacy code that became obsolete after the v0.9.1 TAR architecture migration:
- **PostgreSQL Dialects**: Removed unused `pg_dumpall` branch from `getDumpArgs()` and simplified `getRestoreArgs()` to stub (restore uses `pg_restore` directly)
- **MySQL Dialects**: Removed unused multi-database branch (`--databases ...`) and `--all-databases` fallback from `getDumpArgs()`
- **MongoDB Dialects**: Simplified `getRestoreArgs()` to stub (restore builds args directly in `restore.ts`)
- **Roadmap**: Moved "PostgreSQL Restore Improvements" to completed (handled by TAR architecture)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- New `src/lib/logger.ts` - Centralized logging utility
- New `src/lib/errors.ts` - Custom error class hierarchy
- New `src/lib/types/service-result.ts` - Type-safe service return type
- Migrated core services and adapters to use the new logging system
- Added lint-guard tests to detect `console.*` usage in source files

### 🍃 MongoDB Docker Compatibility
Replaced `mongosh` CLI dependency with native `mongodb` npm package for connection testing:
- **No CLI Dependency**: Connection test and database listing now use the native MongoDB driver instead of `mongosh`
- **Docker Compatible**: The `mongosh` shell is not available in Alpine-based Docker images, but the npm package works everywhere
- **Backup/Restore Unchanged**: `mongodump` and `mongorestore` (from `mongodb-tools`) are still used for actual backup operations
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed shell command parsing in favor of proper MongoDB client API calls

### 🔧 Type-Safe Adapter Configs
Exported TypeScript types from Zod schemas for better developer experience:
- **Inferred Types**: All adapter configs now have exported TypeScript types (e.g., `MySQLConfig`, `PostgresConfig`, `MongoDBConfig`)
- **100% Type-Safe**: All adapter functions (`dump()`, `restore()`, `test()`, `getDatabases()`) now use properly typed configs instead of `config: any`
- **Lint Guard Enforced**: New lint-guard test ensures `config: any` cannot be introduced in adapter files
- **Union Types**: Added `DatabaseConfig`, `StorageConfig`, `NotificationConfig`, `AnyDatabaseConfig` union types for generic handling
- **Extended Types**: Dump/restore functions use extended types with runtime fields (e.g., `MySQLDumpConfig`, `PostgresRestoreConfig`)
- **Better DX**: IDE autocomplete and compile-time error checking for adapter configurations

### 🎯 Interface Type Improvements
Further type safety improvements in the core interfaces:
- **AdapterConfigSchema**: `input` field now uses `z.ZodObject<z.ZodRawShape>` instead of `z.ZodObject<any>`
- **BackupMetadata**: Made extensible with index signature `[key: string]: unknown` for adapter-specific properties
- **BackupResult.metadata**: Changed to `Partial<BackupMetadata>` since adapters often return partial metadata
- **NotificationContext**: New typed interface for notification adapter context with fields like `success`, `duration`, `size`, `status`, `logs`, etc.
- **Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments explaining the type design decisions

## v0.9.3-beta - Redis Support, Restore UX & Smart File Extensions
*Released: February 2, 2026*

This release adds Redis as a new supported database type, introduces a guided restore wizard for Redis, and implements adapter-specific backup file extensions for better file identification.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🗄️ Redis Database Support
- **New Adapter**: Added Redis adapter for backing up Redis databases via RDB snapshots
- **Standalone & Sentinel Mode**: Support for standalone Redis servers and Sentinel high-availability setups
- **Redis 6, 7 & 8**: Full support and test coverage for all current Redis versions
- **ACL Support**: Optional username/password authentication for Redis 6+ Access Control Lists
- **TLS Support**: Secure connections via `--tls` flag
- **Database Selection**: Support for Redis database indices (0-15)

#### 🧙 Redis Restore Wizard
Since Redis cannot restore RDB files remotely, we've built a dedicated step-by-step wizard:
- **Guided Process**: 6-step wizard walks users through the manual restore process
- **Secure Download Links**: Generate temporary, single-use download URLs (5-minute expiry) for wget/curl
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: All commands have one-click copy buttons
- **Platform-Specific**: Separate instructions for Systemd (Linux) and Docker deployments
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual step completion indicators

#### ⚠️ warning Redis Restore Limitations
- **Restore requires server access**: Redis RDB restore cannot be performed remotely. The backup file must be copied to the server's data directory and Redis must be restarted
- **Full server backup only**: RDB snapshots contain all databases (0-15), not individual databases
- **Cluster mode not yet supported**: Only standalone and Sentinel modes are available

#### 📁 Smart Backup File Extensions
Backup files now use appropriate extensions based on the database type:

| Database | Extension | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| MySQL | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| MariaDB | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| PostgreSQL | `.sql` | `backup_2026-02-02.sql.gz.enc` |
| MSSQL | `.bak` | `backup_2026-02-02.bak.gz.enc` |
| MongoDB | `.archive` | `backup_2026-02-02.archive.gz.enc` |
| Redis | `.rdb` | `backup_2026-02-02.rdb.gz.enc` |
| SQLite | `.db` | `backup_2026-02-02.db.gz.enc` |

*Released: February 1, 2026*

This release introduces a unified TAR-based backup format for multi-database backups across all database adapters. This brings consistency, reliability, and new features like selective restore.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Multi-DB Backup Format Changed

The backup format for **multi-database backups** has fundamentally changed from inline SQL/dump streams to TAR archives.

- **Affected**: Multi-DB backups created with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB in versions prior to v0.9.1
- **Not Affected**: Single-database backups remain compatible
- **Action Required**: Old multi-DB backups cannot be restored with v0.9.1+. Keep a copy of v0.9.0 if you need to restore legacy backups, or re-create backups after upgrading

**Why this change?**
- Enables selective restore (choose specific databases)
- Enables database renaming during restore
- Consistent format across all database types
- Eliminates complex stream parsing that was error-prone

### ✨ New Features

#### 📦 Unified TAR Multi-DB Format
- **Consistent Architecture**: All database adapters (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSSQL) now use the same TAR archive format for multi-database backups
- **Manifest File**: Each TAR archive includes a `manifest.json` with metadata about contained databases, sizes, and formats
- **Selective Restore**: Choose which databases to restore from a multi-DB backup
- **Database Renaming**: Restore databases to different names (e.g., `production` → `staging_copy`)

#### 🐘 PostgreSQL Improvements
- **Custom Format**: Multi-DB backups now use `pg_dump -Fc` (custom format) per database instead of `pg_dumpall`
- **Parallel-Ready**: Individual database dumps enable future parallel backup support
- **Smaller Backups**: Custom format includes built-in compression

#### 🍃 MongoDB Multi-DB
- **True Multi-DB Support**: MongoDB adapter now supports backing up multiple selected databases (previously only "all or one")
- **Database Renaming**: Uses `--nsFrom/--nsTo` for restoring to different database names

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Code Reduction**: PostgreSQL restore logic reduced by 53% (592 → 279 LOC) by removing complex Transform streams
- **Shared Utilities**: New `tar-utils.ts` with 18 unit tests for TAR operations
- **Cleaner Adapters**: Removed legacy multi-DB parsing code from all adapters
