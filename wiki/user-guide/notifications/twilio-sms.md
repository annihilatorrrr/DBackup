# SMS (Twilio)

Send SMS notifications for critical backup events via the Twilio API. Works on any mobile phone — no app required.

## Configuration

| Field | Description | Default | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account SID** | Twilio Account SID (starts with `AC`) | — | ✅ |
| **Auth Token** | Twilio Auth Token | — | ✅ |
| **From** | Sender phone number in E.164 format (e.g., `+1234567890`) | — | ✅ |
| **To** | Recipient phone number in E.164 format | — | ✅ |

## Setup Guide

1. Sign up at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) → copy **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the Console Dashboard
2. Under **Phone Numbers** → **Buy a number** with SMS capability (this is your **From** number)
3. In DBackup: **Notifications** → **Add Notification** → **SMS (Twilio)**
4. Enter Account SID, Auth Token, From, and To → **Test** → **Save**

::: tip Trial Accounts
Trial accounts can only send to verified numbers. Add recipients under **Verified Caller IDs** in the Twilio Console. Upgrade for unrestricted sending.

## How It Works

- Messages are optimized for SMS length — only the first 4 fields are included
- Twilio charges per SMS segment (~$0.0079/segment US). Use SMS for **failure-only** notifications and free channels (Discord, ntfy) for success notifications

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| `401: Authentication Error` | Account SID or Auth Token is incorrect |
| `Invalid 'To' Phone Number` | Must be E.164 format: `+` followed by country code and number |
| `Unverified number` | Trial accounts require verified numbers — add in Twilio Console |
| No SMS received | Check Twilio Console → Messaging → Logs for delivery status |
