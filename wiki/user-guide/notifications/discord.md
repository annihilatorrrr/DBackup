## Message Format

Notifications use rich embeds with colored sidebars:

| Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🟢 Green | Success (backup complete, restore finished) |
| 🔴 Red | Failure (backup/restore failed, system error) |
| 🔵 Blue | Informational (user login) |
| 🟣 Purple | System (config backup) |

Each embed includes title, description, structured fields (job name, duration, size), and timestamp.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 — Invalid Webhook Token

Verify the webhook URL is complete. Check the webhook hasn't been deleted in Discord → Server Settings → Integrations.

### 429 — Rate Limited

Too many messages in a short period. Reduce notification frequency — avoid "Always" on high-frequency jobs.

### 404 — Unknown Webhook

The webhook or channel was deleted. Create a new webhook and update the configuration.
