# Rsync

Store backups on a remote server via rsync over SSH. Ideal for efficient incremental transfers and Unix/Linux servers.

## Prerequisites

- `rsync` must be installed on **both** the DBackup server and the remote target
- SSH access to the remote server

::: warning Docker Users
The default DBackup Docker image includes rsync. If you're running DBackup outside Docker, ensure rsync is installed: `which rsync`
:::

## Configuration

::: info Credential Profile required
Rsync requires a [Credential Profile](/user-guide/security/credential-profiles) of type `SSH_KEY`. Create one in **Settings → Vault → Credentials** before saving the destination.
:::

| Field | Description | Default | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | Friendly name for this destination | - | ✅ |
| **Host** | Hostname or IP of the remote server | - | ✅ |
| **Port** | SSH port | `22` | ❌ |
| **Primary Credential** | `SSH_KEY` credential profile (username + key or password) | - | ✅ |
| **Path Prefix** | Remote directory for backups | - | ✅ |
| **Options** | Additional rsync flags (e.g. `--bwlimit=1000`) | - | ❌ |

### Authentication Methods (via `SSH_KEY` profile)

| Auth Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `password` | Username + password via sshpass |
| `privateKey` | SSH private key (PEM format) |
| `agent` | Use the host's SSH agent (keys loaded via `ssh-add`) |

## Setup Guide

1. Create an `SSH_KEY` credential profile in **Settings → Vault → Credentials** ([guide](/user-guide/security/credential-profiles))
2. Ensure the target server has rsync and SSH installed
3. Create a dedicated user with write access to the backup directory:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m dbackup
   sudo mkdir -p /backups/dbackup
   sudo chown dbackup: /backups/dbackup
   ```
4. Go to **Destinations** → **Add Destination** → **Rsync**
5. Enter Host and select the credential profile in the **Primary Credential** picker
6. Set **Path Prefix** to the remote directory (e.g. `/backups/dbackup`)
7. (Optional) Add custom **Options** for bandwidth limiting or other flags
8. Click **Test** to verify the connection

## How It Works

- DBackup invokes `rsync -az` over SSH to transfer backup files
- All transfers are encrypted in transit via SSH
- Custom options are appended to the rsync command
- All credentials (passwords, private keys) are stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in the database

## Troubleshooting

### rsync: command not found

```
rsync: command not found
```

**Solution:** Install rsync on both servers. On Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install rsync`. On the remote server, rsync must be in the default PATH.

### Connection Refused

```
ssh: connect to host ... port 22: Connection refused
```

**Solution:** Verify the host and port. Ensure SSH is running and the firewall allows the connection.

### Permission Denied

```
rsync: mkstemp failed: Permission denied (13)
```

**Solution:** Ensure the SSH user has write access to the Path Prefix directory on the remote server.

### Bandwidth Limiting

To limit transfer speed, add `--bwlimit=1000` (KB/s) in the **Options** field. Useful for avoiding bandwidth saturation on shared connections.
