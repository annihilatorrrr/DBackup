# Roadmap

This page outlines planned features and improvements for DBackup. Features are subject to change based on community feedback and priorities.



## 🚀 Planned Features

### Runner Resilience
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient errors (network timeouts, storage hiccups)
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Move repeatedly failing jobs to a separate status for investigation

### Encryption Key Rotation
- Mechanism to rotate the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` without downtime
- Re-encrypt all stored secrets (DB passwords, SSO client secrets) with the new key
- Rotation guide in documentation

### User Invite Flow
- Email-based user invitations
- Force password change on first login
- Integration with SMTP notification adapter

### Backup Tags & Annotations
- Manually tag backups (e.g., "pre-migration", "before-upgrade")
- Pin backups to protect them from automatic retention policy deletion
- Filter and search by tags in Storage Explorer

### Backup Anomaly Detection
- Alert if backup size deviates significantly from previous runs
- Periodic "test restore" as a scheduled task



## 📊 Dashboard & Monitoring

### Backup Calendar View
- Visual overview of when backups ran (similar to GitHub contribution graph)
- Color-coded status (success, failed, skipped)

### Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
- Expose `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- Metrics: backup count, duration, size, success rate, queue depth
- Grafana dashboard template



## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### End-to-End Test Suite
- Playwright or Cypress tests for critical user flows
- Login → Create job → Run backup → Restore → Verify
- Run in CI pipeline



## 🛠 Database Management & Playground

### Table Browser & Schema Viewer
- Click on a database to browse all tables with columns, data types, primary keys, and indexes
- Row counts per table for quick anomaly detection
- Visual schema overview for backup verification

### Backup Drift Detection
- Compare current database state with last backup timestamp
- Show changes since last backup (new tables, size growth, dropped objects)
- Alert when databases have drifted significantly from their last backup

### Server Health Dashboard
- Display server uptime, active connections, running queries, replication status
- Per-adapter health metrics (MySQL: `SHOW STATUS`, PostgreSQL: `pg_stat_activity`)
- Pre-backup health check indicator

### Direct SQL Execution
- Connect directly to configured database sources
- Execute custom SQL queries from the web UI (read-only by default)
- Query result visualization with export to CSV/JSON
- Write mode behind separate permission (`SOURCES.QUERY_WRITE`)

### Query Library
- Pre-built templates for common tasks (user management, table maintenance)
- Quick-action buttons in the UI

### Data Preview
- Preview first 50 rows of any table without writing custom queries
- Inline data viewer in the Table Browser

### User & Privileges Viewer
- Read-only view of database users and their permissions
- Verify backup user has sufficient privileges
- Security audit helper

### Storage Trend Graph
- Historical database size over time (derived from backup metadata)
- Growth rate visualization for capacity planning



## 🎨 Nice-to-Have

### Internationalization (i18n)
- Multi-language UI support
- Community-contributed translations

### Mobile Responsive UI
- Optimized layouts for tablet and mobile devices
- Status monitoring on the go

### Backup Size Limits & Alerts
- Warning when backups are unexpectedly large or small
- Configurable thresholds per job

### Dark Mode Refinement
- Systematic review of all components for dark mode consistency
- High-contrast accessibility mode
